DBMS Project : 
This project focuses on the creation of a travel booking database management system that utilizes MySQL and Node.js. The system is designed to provide users with an easy and efficient way to search for trekking places and book the desired location for trekkiing.

Future Enhancements :
We will be working on the project for providing trekking companies and organizations with a tool
to manage their inventory of trekking options and track customer bookings.The next step for our
project would be helping trekking companies to analyze and improve their trekking offerings based
on customer feedback and data.
